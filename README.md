# 🚀 My First Chat App

Welcome to my very first chat application! 🎉


## 🤔 What's This?

This project is my very first attempt at building a chat application using WebSockets, specifically with **Socket.IO**. It might not look like much, but it's a big step for me into the world of real-time communication.

## 💡 Features

- **Real-Time Chat**: Experience the thrill of instant messaging (or, you know, close enough 😅).
- **Socket.IO Integration**: My first dive into WebSockets—bear with me, it’s a work in progress.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration (because privacy matters, right?).
- **Basic UI**: Not the prettiest, but it gets the job done! (Designers, look away! 👀)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **WebSockets**: Socket.IO
- **Database**: MongoDB
